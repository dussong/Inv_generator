# TO DO: Not automatized yet.

1 - run generate_invariants.sh with wanted Nbody and degree parameters.
This creates files in data

2- NOT NEEDED ANYMORE
2 - copy the files
a - NB_?_deg_?_irr_invariants.jl
b - NB_?_deg_?_prim_invariants.jl
c - NB_?_deg_?_non_efficient_invariants.jl
d - NB_?_deg_?_relations_invariants.jl
into the data folder

3 NOT NEEDED ANYMORE
3 - do the following manipulations on these files :
In NB_?_deg_?_non_efficient_invariants.jl
a - check that no line starts with a + (otherwise wring computation of the invariants - check in particular pv[17] and pv[18]), and if there is, move the + to the previous line.

4 - run src_jl/generate_text_invariants.jl.
This generates the invariants in:
NB_?_deg_?_invariants.jl

5 - NOT NEEDED ANYMORE
5 - copy-paste the definition of the invariants into the corresponding file in test and use the relations between irreducible secondaries and secondaries to compute all of them.


6 - you can run test_invariants.jl to test them. For the moment, 4 primary invariants are not right.
